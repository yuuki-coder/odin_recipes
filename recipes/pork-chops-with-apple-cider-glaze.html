        <p>Pork chops with a glossy apple cider glaze is really easy, and while there's no starch or extra butter involved, it reduces quickly to a thick, rich, sweet-tart apple syrup.</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>6 (6 ounce) boneless center-cut pork chops</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>2 cups apple cider</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced rosemary</li>
            <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Season pork chops with salt and black pepper.</li></p>
            <li><p>Heat oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork chops in the hot oil mixture until browned on both sides and pork is slightly pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove pan from the heat; transfer pork chops to a plate.</li></p>
            <li><p>Stir garlic into the pan and place over medium-high heat; cook and stir for 30 seconds. Pour in vinegar and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add apple cider and Dijon mustard, bring mixture to a boil, and cook until sauce is reduced and thick, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in rosemary and red pepper flakes; season with salt and black pepper to taste.</li></p>
            <li><p>Return pork chops to the pan to warm slightly, 1 to 2 minutes per side.</li></p>
        </ol>
